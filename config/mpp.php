    | Settlement methods (rails)
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Each method maps to a Verifier implementation plus its configuration.
    | The protocol layer is rail-agnostic: every rail shares the one MPP wire
    | format, and settlement sits behind the Verifier interface so additional
    | rails can be added without touching it.
    |
    | ADDING A RAIL is up to three steps:
    |   1. Implement Square1\Mpp\Settlement\Verifier (verify a settlement PROOF
    |      against the Challenge — never trust the client's word). For a rail
    |      whose settlement is a pre-existing external transaction (rather than a
    |      synchronous API call you initiate), implement a
    |      Square1\Mpp\Settlement\SettlementChecker and reuse the matching logic
    |      pattern in TempoVerifier.
    |   2. If the rail's 402 `request` payload is not the default fiat shape
    |      (amount in minor units, currency, methodDetails), implement a
    |      Square1\Mpp\Protocol\Requests\RailRequestBuilder and set it as
    |      `request_builder` in the method block. Omit this only for a genuinely
    |      Stripe-shaped fiat rail; otherwise the fiat builder mints the wrong
    |      request shape for your rail.
    |   3. Add a `methods.<name>` block here with at least a `verifier` (and the
    |      `request_builder` from step 2 if you wrote one). Use it on a route with
    |      `method=<name>`, or make it the house rail with `default_method`.
    | Nothing in the protocol layer needs to change.
    |
    | VALIDATION: the gate checks a rail's config the first time a route offers it
    | (keyed on the verifier). A shipped rail missing a value its 402 cannot be
    | minted or paid without — Tempo's recipient/token/chain_id — throws
    | InvalidConfigurationException so the mistake surfaces immediately. A merely
    | recommended value (Stripe's secret_key/network_id, Tempo's rpc_url) logs a
    | one-time warning instead, so "emit the 402 now, settle once configured" stays
    | a valid workflow. Custom verifiers are skipped — validate their own config.
